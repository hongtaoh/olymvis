      <description>One of first few attempts to compare changes in female participation in the Summer Olympics over 120 years in different continents. This new insight will be important because although data shows that overall female participation in the Olympics has been increasing dramatically, this might have been the case for each continent. Further investigation into the percentage of female athletes in each of the six continents (Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, North America, and Oceania) will reveal deeper information about the trend of female athletes participation.</description>

      <description>The main data set used in this project is the awesome Olympic_history by rgriff23.
Other complementary data sets:
  continent.csv is used for extracting the ISO-3166 three letter country code and the corresponding continent name.
  host_countries.csv is used in vis 3.
  continent_4.xlsx is used to extract the IOC (International Olympic Committee) country codes and the ISO-3166 three letter country codes. We merge continent_4 with continent to get the corresponding continent name of each IOC code.</description>
