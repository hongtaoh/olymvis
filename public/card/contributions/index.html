<meta name="twitter:description" content="One of first few attempts to compare changes in female participation in the Summer Olympics over 120 years in different continents. This new insight will be important because although data shows that overall female participation in the Olympics has been increasing dramatically, this might have been the case for each continent. Further investigation into the percentage of female athletes in each of the six continents (Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, North America, and Oceania) will reveal deeper information about the trend of female athletes participation."/>

<p>One of first few attempts to compare changes in female participation in the Summer Olympics over 120 years in different continents.

<p>Introducing KDE in examining home-field advantage in the Olympics. This method makes it possible to show the density of each host country’s performance distribution, which makes the comparison between “home” and “away” performance clearer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction of the concept of “medal efficiency”. Earlier attempts either lacked taking into account of “medal points” or unfairly included GDP and population in their formula. Our way of calculating medal efficiency, i.e., weighted medal points per athlete participating, can more accurately estimate each country’s efficiency of producing medals in the Summer Olympics.</p>
