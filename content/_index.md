This study analyzed the <a herf = "https://github.com/rgriff23/Olympic_history" style="padding-bottom: 1px;border-bottom: 1px solid;">historical data</a> which contains information on athletes in all the past modern Olympic Games. We tried to answer four questions:

- how female participation changed over the years and how these changes differed between continents?
- whether there is a home-field advantage at the Olympics?
- how "efficient" is each participating country and region to get medals? and 
- which sports had the highest number of participants?

<div class="quote-right">

> Both total number of athletes and the rate of female participation have been increasing in the past 120 years. 

</div>

Results showed that both total number of athletes and the rate of female participation have been increasing in the past 120 years. Also, there seems to exist a home-field advantage. Third, medal efficiency is highly correlated with participating country or region's economic development. Finally, athletics, gymnastics, and swimming have the highest number of athletes.
